# Achieverz

The project consists of developing a professional platform that connects tech freelancers and employers who need their service. There are two types users and the administrator who manages the platform.


The first user is the employer.  The platform allows him to create an account so that he can post projects.  Then, he can consult the profiles of the candidates and as soon as he finds a profile that suits him, he chooses one or more candidates.  After confirmation of the project, communication between the employer and the candidate will take place outside the platform.


The second user is the freelance.  The platform also allows him to create an account and a profile on which he adds his field of specialty, his skills and his professional experiences.  He consults the projects available on the platform, then he can apply for one or more projects.  He has the possibility of consulting his applications so that he can know their status, for example if the recruiter has seen his application or not.  He will be informed once a recruiter has chosen him for a project.


The role of the administrator is to manage the platform.  He has the authority to consult and delete user accounts, all projects and applications.
